Hi,
after upgrading to the latest and greatest my website is messed up and this msg is front and center: 
Warning: call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback, class 'ReduxFramework' does not have a method 'vc_fixes' in F:\InstantWP_4.4.2\iwpserver\htdocs\wordpress\wp-includes\plugin.php on line 525
What gives?
Thanks.
Bo
